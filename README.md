# Lifen Challenge

This repo is my solution to the [Lifen recruitment exercise](https://github.com/honestica/frontend-jobs).

## How to start

First, run `npm install`. This can take a while because it will download Electron.

- Browser : `npm start`
- Desktop : `npm run electron`

## Caveat

The number of files on the server as returned by the API is sometimes out of date.
